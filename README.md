## The power of Google Search in your command line.

The CLI display results from the [Google Web Search API](https://developers.google.com/web-search/), allows you to page through the results, and choose a page to view, all without leaving the command line.

## Features

* You have access to all the [search operators](http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=136861) you've come to know and love in Google Search.

* If using the `--lucky` or `--result` flags, you can pipe the results into any other unix command.

* Results are filtered through [Readability](http://www.readability.com/), so you only get the relevant content. (Shoutout to [Ruby Readability](https://github.com/iterationlabs/ruby-readability)!)

* Results are shown in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for a good balance between legibility and document heirarchy. (Shoutout to [reverse_markdown](https://github.com/xijo/reverse_markdown)!)

* Results pages are formatted to look like a Google SERP, including colors, domains, descriptions, and bold search matches. (Shoutout to [formatador](https://github.com/geemus/formatador)!)

* You can pipe a result into a another unix command! At the prompt, type the number of the result, followed by a pipe as normal. Note that utilities such as `less` and `more` that need to control the display don't work.

For example,

    Enter N or P for pagination, E or Q to quit, or a number to see that result.
