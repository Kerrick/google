They are also listed here.\r\n\r\n    The google gem is a simple tool to search Gooogle with via a CLI.\r\n    Usage:\r\n        google [options] \"my search query string here\"\r\n    where [options] are:\r\n            --page, -p <i>:   Start by showing the <i>th result page. (Default: 1)\r\n            --size, -s <i>:   Show <i> results on each SERP. Must be between 1 and 8. (Default: 4)\r\n          --result, -r <i>:   Skip the SERP and show the <i>th result.\r\n               --lucky, -l:   I'm feeling lucky! Skip the SERP and show the first result. (Alias to --result 1)\r\n      --no-readability, -e:   Filter the results through readability to get rid of extra content. (Default: true)\r\n         --no-markdown, -m:   Change the results from raw HTML to markdown. (Default: true)\r\n             --version, -v:   Print the version and exit.\r\n                --help, -h:   Show this information and exit.\r\n\r\n### I'm Feeling Lucky into Less\r\n\r\n    google -l 'how to install nvidia drivers debian squeeze' | less\r\n\r\n### Search on a single site\r\n\r\n    google 'site:randsinrepose.com NADD'\r\n\r\n### Vanity Search\r\n\r\n    google '\"Kerrick Long\" -inurl:kerrick -inurl:kerricklong'\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* You have access to all the [search operators](http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=136861) you've come to know and love in Google Search.\r\n\r\n* If using the `--lucky` or `--result` flags, you can pipe the results into any other unix command.\r\n\r\n* Results are filtered through [Readability](http://www.readability.com/), so you only get the relevant content. (Shoutout to [Ruby Readability](https://github.com/iterationlabs/ruby-readability)!)\r\n\r\n* Results are shown in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for a good balance between legibility and document heirarchy. (Shoutout to [reverse_markdown](https://github.com/xijo/reverse_markdown)!)\r\n\r\n* Results pages are formatted to look like a Google SERP, including colors, domains, descriptions, and bold search matches. (Shoutout to [formatador](https://github.com/geemus/formatador)!)\r\n\r\n* You can pipe a result into another unix command! At the prompt, type the number of the result, followed by a pipe as normal. Note that utilities such as `less` and `more` that need to control the display don't work.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n    Enter N or P for pagination, E or Q to quit, or a number to see that result.\r\n    > 3 | espeak -a 200 -v en-us\r\n\r\n## Supported Ruby Versions\r\n\r\nThis library has only been tested against Ruby 1.9.3.
